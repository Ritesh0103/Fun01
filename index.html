      <h2 class="card-title">Love</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Love is a feeling. There would probably be no clear definition of love. Since it is a feeling, 
        it is meant to be felt.
         Love is so hard to define
          because there are various forms of it.
          Love is the basis of relationships between friends, family,
           and partners. The feeling of love and the maintenance of this requires natural trust, compassion, respect, and a sense of protection and acknowledgment toward each other.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Friendship</h2>
      <p>Friendship is a relationship with various feelings between two or more friends.
        The friends have a sense of mutual trust, compassion, concern, and sharing of opinions, hobbies, or other interests.

Maintaining a friendship with someone throughout life is tricky, as our interests, hobbies, and lifestyle tend to change as we age.

Some friendships begin young, while others begin later in life. It is the most loyal and committed feeling person can have.
